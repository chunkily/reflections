What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

	An empty repository is created when you run git init with 0 commits.
	No files will be tracked.
	We need to init because... we need to start the first version somewhere.
	
How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

	staging area is like, a temporary place to show what you are going to change
	it's value is in showing what we will change before committing, which may be important if we are commiting to production.
	
How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

	git diff to compare staging area and working directory
	git diff --staged to compare latest(?) commit and staging area
	
What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?

	when we are adding features that may change functionality greatly.
	branching so that we still have a stable version.

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure

	Can see where the seperation occured so can see what may or may not be included in each branch.
	
What is the result of merging 2 branches together? Why do we represent it in the diagram the way we do?

    Merging 2 branches together adds all commits together
    A merged commit will have multiple parents because it has to contain the changes made to all the merged branches.
