When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
    When you want to be able to work on a project with other people or from multiple computers

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
    The same reason why we do not want to do automatic merging. 
    So we can be more sure of the state of the current repository
